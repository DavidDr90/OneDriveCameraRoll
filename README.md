Order images in folders based on the date they was taken

Microsoft OneDrive offers images and video backup services from any mobile device to OneDrive storage.
Origianly the OneDrive just collect the images and videos and store then in one large folder without any order
In recent days Micrsofot introduce a featre in the image backup service that will store the images in folders based on the date the image was taken
for example: image that was taken in May 2022 will be save in this path: camera roll\2022\05

This small script was created to help order any older images, taken before the new feature was implemented by OneDrive team
You can run this script on any geiven folder with images and it will reorder all images to be in the right folder based on the year and month they were taken
